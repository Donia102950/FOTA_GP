***problems

1- Qstring is not defined ---> solved by function that maps Qstring to str()
2- passing a c file with an argument to python script to make output file -> solved by (changing ./a.out to ./a.exe)
3- undefined "self" name is used -> solved by putting the function using self in the class UI_Form
4- readline of file invalid literal for int with base 10 -> solved by using line.split() & by casting the string to float then to int
5- if we run the gui then run the c file, the c file would take the terminal -> solved by running both the gui and the c file on threads to run concurrently by calling self.connect & self.emit 
6- the progress bar didn't update whenever a packet was flashed -> solved by putting a delay to match the speed between the progress bar to read the progess.txt file and the time the pc writes on the file
7- the progress.txt file wasn't proberly initialized when the send button is pressed, led to progressBar not functioning proberly -> solved by initializing the progress.txt file with the value (0 0) when the send button is pressed
8- TODO: update the feature of comm port detection: the function fetches the first comm port present in the PC (in case there are multiple comm ports connected on pc, might lead to connect with the wrong port)
9- TODO: update the ELF_file automation: the script would search in the path for the elf file rather than presenting it in the script


***Code Documentation:

1- The first step after you run the GUI would be to choose which machine you would like to flash the elf file specified to that machine.
2- QString() function that converts its input to str(), it overrides the default QString function in the QCore.
3- in Class Progress (a ProgressBar Thread Class) a run(self) is used to make a runnable thread for the progressBar that reads from the progress.txt file and update its value (the function that has a signal that is emitted to reset the value of the progressBar to be 0 at the beginning of the run)
   * the function then reads the values in the progress.txt and calculate how many packets of the total packets are flashed, and emits a signal to update the progressBar with the percentage of the total flashing operation
4- a run(self) used to make a runnable thread to compile and run the C files needed to send and flash the elf file on the machine
   * the function checks for the port commnumber and the elf file are presented to start running the execution file to parse and flash the elf packets
5- Ui_Form is the function generated by the pyside2 used to make the GUI
6- Connecting the signals from the buttons so that they would call a specific function
   * Connect_Button (Send) in the GUI is connected to the GenerateFunction, so once the Send Button is pressed the GenerateFunction is called
   * pushButton (Search) in the GUI is connected to ComFunction, once the Search Button is pressed it would fetch the commPort Number from the PC
7- create an Object from class Progress (in point 2) named progressView to connect its runnable with a function __updateProgressBar
8- GenerateFunction is the Function call when Button Send is pressed :
   * Check if the entered path for the elf file is a valid path, in case not valid generate an error dialogue window
   * in case the path is valid, it would take the CommPort Number and the elf file, import them to the CommReceive.c file and start its thread
   * check for the progress.txt if it is in the valid path or not, in case not valid it would generate an error dialogue window
   * in case a valid path for the progress.txt file, it would initialize it with value (0 0), then connect a signal between progressView with the function __updateProgressBar (in point 7)
9- ComFunction (in point 6 sub-section 2) fetches all the current commports on the PC (using class port_list from serial.tools.list_ports  i.e. it needs to have pyserial on the PC: run the following command in admin cmd -> pip install pyserial)
   * if ports are not available, it would generate an error dialogue window
   * it ports are availablem, use regex to fetch all the ports and add them to a tuple, and take the first instance (would be updated in Point number 8 in Problems section)
10- __updateProgressBar Function takes an input argument percent to update the progressBar Value with that percent.
    * the function sets the value of the progressBar with the percent calculated and passed to it as an input argument (in point 3 sub-section)
    * if the percent is 0, the status of the progress bar is set to "Setup"
    * if the percent is less than 100, the status of the progress bar is set to "in progress"
    * if the percent is equal to 100, then the status of the progress bar is set to "Done"
11- start function is used to run the progressView Thread
